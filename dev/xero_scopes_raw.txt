Offline access
To get a refresh token, you must request the offline_access scope. A refresh token allows you to refresh your access token and maintain an offline connection.

User scopes
OpenID Connect
Use OpenID scopes to retrieve details about the user’s identity. These are required for single sign on.

openid	your application intends to use the user’s identity

Request these scopes if your app needs to access data in a Xero Organisation

Accounting API
Broad scopes are being replaced by granular scopes. All apps created from March 2, 2026 will use the new granular scopes. Existing apps will be assigned the new granular scopes by the end of April 2026, and broad scopes will remain available until September 2027. We encourage you to adopt the new granular scopes as soon as they’re assigned to your app.

Broad scopes being replaced are marked "Deprecated". New granular scopes are marked "New".
